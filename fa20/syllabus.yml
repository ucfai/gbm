      Welcome to our first GBM meeting! This meeting will be heavily discussion-based, talking about a variety of interesting AI ethical issues like use in medical fields,
      politics, laws limiting AI, consciousness, and creating "human" AI. This is a great way to dip your toes into a field of AI many people often joke about or just say "AI
      will take over the world." Can our society properly regulate and use AI in the future? Come and discuss the answers to this question!

      Ever watch a TV show or movie that depicts robots taking over the world? In this meeting, we'll discuss how different forms of media perceive AI, from movies to news outlets to global tech experts. We'll also be clearing up misconceptions about the future of artificial intelligence (hint - robots are NOT taking over the world).

      Whether it be self-driving cars, facial recognition, or virtual assistants, artificial intelligence seems to be making its way into nearly every aspect of our society. 
      With AI's migration from just science fiction into the real world, one might wonder how we got here, or where was the "hype" ten to twenty years ago?
      In this meeting, AI@UCF will delve into the history of AI, uncovering the major figures and milestones that led us to where we are today.
