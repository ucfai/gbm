      Welcome to our first GBM meeting! This meeting will be heavily discussion-based, talking about a variety of interesting AI ethical issues like use in medical fields,
      politics, laws limiting AI, consciousness, and creating "human" AI. This is a great way to dip your toes into a field of AI many people often joke about or just say "AI
      will take over the world." Can our society properly regulate and use AI in the future? Come and discuss the answers to this question!

      Ever watch a TV show or movie that depicts robots taking over the world? In this meeting, we'll discuss how different forms of media perceive AI, from movies to news outlets to global tech experts. We'll also be clearing up misconceptions about the future of artificial intelligence (hint - robots are NOT taking over the world).
